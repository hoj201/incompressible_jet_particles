  After testing the algorithm many times, using conservation of Energy as a sanity check, we
appear to have energy conservation when particles are far and virtually isolated.  This
persists regardless of how small I make the time step.  This suggests that the continuous time
algorithm is not converging to the correct equations and there is bug.  In particular
it is a bug associated to the coupling between one-jets and zero-jets.

  There is also a problem with the coupling of one-jets to each other when the zero-jet momentum is absent.  So there seems to be a general problem with the one-jet couplings.

    The Hamiltonian function appears fixed (it was occasionally negative before, now it is strictly positive as it should be). There is a new function which tests all the other functions and there computed derivatives by comparing the computed quantites with finite difference approximations.  It appears that there may be problems with the second derivatives of the kernel.

    Something is wrong with the calculation of the second order derivatives of Guassians.  Consider recoding this.

    The Guassians and there derivatives have been vetted.  However, there appears to be a bug in the calculation of D2K (although K and DK both work).

    The derivatives of Guassians and Kernel functions both work.

    The integrator seems to be working and all functions are computed accurately. Therefore I have begun conducting numerical expirements.

    head_on_collision : I sent two zero-jet particles at position (-2,0) and (2,0) heading towards each other with momenta (1,0) and (-1,0).  In finite time the particles get very close to touching (somewhere between 8 and 16 seconds) and the momenta goes to infinity.
